Block: Displays an element as a block element. It starts on a new line, and takes up the whole width.
Inline-block: Displays an element as an inline-level block container. The element itself is formatted as an inline element, but you can apply height and width values.


Border: Every box has a border. The border separates the edge of one box from another.
Styling: Width, style, color, shorthand.
Margin: Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
