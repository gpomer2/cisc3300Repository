        <h1>George</h1>
        <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
            the page. And if the page is a long one it might
            be split up into several sub-headings.
        <p>
        <h2>Computer Science</h2>
        <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
            you follow the structure of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
            headings).
        </p>
        <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
        <p>Not completely sure about my career aspirations but like coding and working in HTML.</p>
